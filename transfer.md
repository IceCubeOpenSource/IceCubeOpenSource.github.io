# IceCube Open Source

## Transferring Code

1. Code is on GitHub

   If your code is already on GitHub under a personal account, you can go
   into settings and [transfer] it to `IceCubeOpenSource`.

1. Code is in SVN at code.icecube.wisc.edu

   Tell us where it is located, and we can transfer the code into the
   GitHub project.  Note that we do a best effort to transfer author
   information for commits, but if your SVN and GitHub accounts have
   different email addresses then they will not be associated unless
   you tell us.

1. Code is in some random directory

   Tell us where to find it, or tar it up and send it to us.
   With this method, you won't get any historical author information.

## Transferred repository ownership

Once code is transferred, you should become a member of [IceCubeOpenSource]
so we can assign you as the maintainer of the project.  Just tell us
your GitHub username and we can take care of the rest.
