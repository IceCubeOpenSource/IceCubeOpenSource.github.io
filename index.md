# IceCube Open Source

## About

IceCube Open Source is a gathering of several open source projects
by the [IceCube Collaboration].

### IceCube Open Source Owners
The current owners are made up of various internal IceCube software managers: 
* Claudio Kopper
* David Schultz
* Juan Carlos Diaz Velez
* Kevin Meagher
* Don La Dieu
* Nathan Whitehorn
* Alex Olivas
* Philipp Eller

## Projects

* [mem-scope-track](https://github.com/IceCubeOpenSource/mem-scope-track)

* [SkyLab](https://github.com/IceCubeOpenSource/skylab)

### How do I get my project here?

If you are a member of IceCube and want your project to appear here,
follow these steps:

1. Contact us

   Talk to the software group (email, slack).  If you don't want to
   tell everyone yet, send a message to the software coordinator (olivas@icecube.umd.edu).

1. Code review

   A [limited code review](code_review.html) must be performed to ensure
   a basic level of quality to make it public (private is OK for projects
   under development).

1. Licensing

   Pick one of the popular [open sources licenses](https://choosealicense.com/).

1. Transfer repository to [IceCubeOpenSource].

   The final step is to [move the source code](transfer.html) to an
   official project under this organization.
   Note: This does not constitute a transfer of ownership in any legal sense.
   Authors still maintain ownership and retain full admin privileges over their projects.

### Benefits of hosted projects

If all that sounds like a lot of work for no gain, don't despair!
Not only will we help guide you through this process, once a project
is officially hosted we provide limited support for it:

* Compiler / library support - as new versions are released, we help fix
  errors in your code.

* Help with continuous integration / testing.

* New maintainer locating - we'll help find someone new to maintain it
  if you drop the project.


### Project Author Policy
Project authors retain full ownership privileges of their projects and therefore
retain the right to determine the development of their project.  This means:

1. Veto Commit Privileges - Project authors have veto privileges over who can commit
   directly (w/o PR) to their projects.

1. Veto PR Privileges - Project authors have the right to reverse or reject pull requests.

#### Conflict Resolution Policy
It's conceivable a conflict could arise, for example an author is determined not to support
Python 3, but IceCube has decided to officially drop support for Python 2.  IceCube retains
the right to move the project in this direction against the wishes of the author, but only
with unanimous consent of all IceCube Open Source Organization Owners, after hearing from
the author.

### Project Abandonment
IceCube is agreeing to assume any maintenance burden the author can't.  It's reasonable
to expect authors will stay in touch with the collaboration.  If an author fails to respond
to any communication with all IceCube Open Source Owners they forfeit all ownership rights to
the project and the project will be considered abandoned.  At least three (3) attempts should
be made (and documented) separated by at least three (3) weeks.  If authors fail to respond
to any IceCube Open Source Owner, by any means, that constitutes a failure to respond.
Forfeiture of ownership must be unanimously approved by all IceCube Open Source Owners.
