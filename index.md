# IceCube Open Source

## About

IceCube Open Source is a gathering of several open source projects
by the [IceCube Collaboration].

## Projects

* [SkyLab](https://github.com/IceCubeOpenSource/skylab)

### How do I get my project here?

If you are a member of IceCube and want your project to appear here,
follow these steps:

1. Contact us
.. Talk to the software group (email, slack).  If you don't want to
.. tell everyone yet, send a message to the software coordinator.
1. Code review
.. A [limited code review](code_review.html) must be performed to ensure
.. a basic level of quality.
1. Licensing
.. Pick one of the popular [open sources licenses](https://choosealicense.com/).
1. Transfer repository to [IceCubeOpenSource].
.. The final step is to [move the source code](transfer.html) to an
.. official project under this organization.

### Benefits of hosted projects

If all that sounds like a lot of work for no gain, don't despair!
Not only will we help guide you through this process, once a project
is officially hosted we provide limited support for it:

* Compiler support - as new compiler versions are released, we help fix bugs.
* Help with CI / testing.
